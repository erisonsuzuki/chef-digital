# Execution Instruction: Chef Digital

## 1. Core Context
Chef Digital is a full-stack web application that uses Groq AI and Serper API to manage recipes.  
Users can add recipes via text, image, or video link.  
Images and videos are never stored — only the extracted text and source link are processed.

## 2. Action Plan (Blueprint)
